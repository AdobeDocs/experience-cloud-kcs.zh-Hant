# VEC常見問題集和常見問題

## 說明

本檔案旨在列出VEC疑難排解常見問題集，以及與 [!DNL Target] VEC

## 解析度

初步檢查

1. <b>查詢參數</b>

   檢查 [!UICONTROL 網站] 允許查詢參數

   VEC會自動附加下列查詢參數至頁面URL: `mboxEdit=1` &amp; `mboxDisable=1`.

   因此，請在個別索引標籤中開啟網站，並在結尾附加上述查詢參數，並觀察是否有任何問題

   如果客戶網站是：www.customerwebsite.com，請開啟新標籤並勾選： www.customerwebsite.com?mboxEdit=1&amp;mboxDisable=1

1. <b>應允許混合的內容</b>

   若客戶使用自訂作用中內容，例如JavaScript和CSS檔案，則應透過HTTPS而非HTTP下載。

   參考檔案https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/troubleshoot-composer/mixed-content.html?lang=en

1. <b>網頁應可在iframe記憶體取。</b>

   您可以前往https://jsbin.com/ and ，將程式碼貼到下方，查看客戶網站是否支援iframe，或是封鎖iframe，查看客戶網站是否在iframe中開啟：

   ```
   !DOCTYPE html
   html
   head
   
  meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot; titleJS Bin/title /head body iframe src=&quot;https://www.facebook.com&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; /iframe /body /html

```
Replace facebook.com with the website URL

There could be one or multiple iframe busting techniques used, few of which are listed below

- X-Frame-Options header

  X-Frame-Options: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options

  This header can be removed if needed via Requestly ([!DNL Chrome] Extension) as described on public the documentation: 

  Reference Document: https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/target/using/experiences/vec/troubleshoot-composer/troubleshooting-issues-related-to-the-visual-experience-composer-vec.html

- JS Based Iframe Busting

This can be done through various JavaScript code.

A basic example:
```
指令碼if（頂部）= window){ body.style.display = none;} /script

```
There are plenty of other JavaScript iFrame Busting techniques and can be seen the most used on this link:

https://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/framebusting/framebust.pdf

1. <b>Following [!DNL Target] JS scripts are downloaded</b>

- `target-vec.js`

- `target-vec-helper.js`

1. <b>If the DOM structure has changed there could be errors in VEC where configured modifications are not visible in VEC.</b>

Figure out - Selector for which action is broken: In Console, you can check using: `_AT.querySelectorAll('selector')`

Reference Document for selector configuration: https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/vec/vec-selectors.html?lang=en#

1. <b>Handle duplicate Ids on the page:</b> As [!DNL Target] uses selectors of the page to create and deliver recommendations, so it is essential to ensure that the page is a compiant to the below points

- Use Classes
- Use unique attributes present in the elements
- Check if the selector matches the Unique element
- Remove dynamic `classNames` from selectors like `active`, `selected`, etc.

1. <b>Please make sure elements are not contained within an iframe itself, as VEC loads content in an iframe so iframe within a parent iframe would not work.</b>

Common issues:

1. Unable to log in to Online Banking in VEC to perform HTML Edit

 - Adobe Target VEC requires the VEC helper extension to load the page.

 - Allow insecure content from the site settings.

 - Set the EEC as disabled.

 - Navigate the page in VEC using the "Browse mode"

 - Click on [!UICONTROL Compose] to do the changes.


1. Trigger views are not available within VEC to create modifications

 The page may be using service workers which would not allow trigger views to be available. Here are the steps to work around this scenario

 - After loading the page in VEC, make sure to disable EEC from [!UICONTROL Page Delivery], disable service workers and enable both options in the VEC Helper Extension: Inject [!DNL Target] Libraries and Cookies
 
 - Click Browse and click Accept Cookies.
 
 - Click in the address bar from the VEC page and press Enter so that the page refreshes properly within VEC. View names should show up including in the overlay.
 
 - Ensure that the Trigger views function is consistently firing on the page. Views will be available only when the trigger view function fires.



1. Unable to access authorized pages within VEC

Access the authorized page in a browser outside VEC. Then access the page in [!DNL Target], in the new browser tab of the same window 

1. Unable to access the page using Shadow DOM within [!DNL Target] VEC

 - Ensure that the page is using the latest [!DNL Target] library
 - Ensure that all the web components are loaded before the page is accessed in VEC

1. Unable to accept cookies and browse the website within VEC

 Access the cookies browser outside VEC. Then access the page in [!DNL Target], in the new browser tab of the same window
