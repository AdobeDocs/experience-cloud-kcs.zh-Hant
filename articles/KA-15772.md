# 將體驗片段從一個子資料夾複製到另一個

## 說明



```
Suppose there is a folder 'myfolder' under the path of '/content/experience-fragments', and from the 'Experience Fragment' properties console, custom Experience 
Fragment template have been added under the 'Allowed Template' property. Now when trying to copy/move an experience fragment from one sub-folder 'test-1' to 
another sub-folder 'test-2', an error will be shown in the GUI console and the paste/move operation fails with:

'/content/experience-fragments/_1/_1_1/test-xf (Experience Fragment Template) not allowed below /content/experience-fragments/_1/test-xf.
```



## 解析度



```
In order to enable to copy/move operation on the sub-folders one more path needs to be added under the cq:allowedTemplates property of the parent folder 
'/libs/cq/experience-fragments/components/experiencefragment/template'. This is because the copy/move operation is tightly coupled with default experience 
fragment components at path '/libs/cq/experience-fragments/components/experiencefragment/template'.
```
